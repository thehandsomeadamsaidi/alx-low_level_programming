 Ongoing second chance project - started Jul 27, 2023 4:00 AM, must end by Jul 29, 2023 4:00 AM
 An auto review will be launched at the deadline
In a nutshell…
Auto QA review: 0.0/43 mandatory & 0.0/12 optional
Altogether:  0.0%
Mandatory: 0.0%
Optional: 0.0%
Calculation:  0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%)  == 0.0%
Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Data Structures


Resources
Read or watch:

Linked Lists
Google
Youtube
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
When and why using linked lists vs arrays
How to build and use linked lists
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
More Info
Please use this data structure for this project:

/**
 * struct list_s - singly linked list
 * @str: string - (malloc'ed string)
 * @len: length of the string
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 */
typedef struct list_s
{
    char *str;
    unsigned int len;
    struct list_s *next;
} list_t;
Quiz questions

Tasks
0. Print list
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

Prototype: size_t print_list(const list_t *h);
Return: the number of nodes
Format: see example
If str is NULL, print [0] (nil)
You are allowed to use printf
